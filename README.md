# Azure Machine Learning Python SDK notebooks

Welcome to my Azure Machine Learning Python SDK notebooks repository!

## What is an Azure Machine Learning workspace?

Azure ML Workspace is an Azure resource that coordinates storage, databases, and compute resources providing added functionality for machine learning experimentation, deployment, inference, and the monitoring of deployed models.

When you are running your code in Azure Notebooks or another Microsoft managed environment, the SDK is already installed.
Else: you should follow the steps in the [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-configure-environment) to congfigure your environment.
